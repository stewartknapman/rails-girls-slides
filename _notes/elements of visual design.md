# Elements of Visual Design

## Introduction

Hello. I am Stewart Knapman. I am a designer and front-end developer.
I work for a small, but mighty, design studio in Nelson called Lucid.
We specialise in building websites for small to medium sized businesses,
and mainly work with an e-commerce platform called Shopify.
Which, by the way, is built on top of Ruby on Rails.
It is also just one of the platforms that we use on a daily basis that
is either built on, or influenced by Ruby and the Rails framework.

So, I'm going to take you through a little bit of about what
Visual Design is; _why_ we need it; and then finish up with some rules
or guidelines on how we can use it in our apps to create
great experiences.

## What is Visual Design?

So what is Visual Design, and why do we care?
Visual Design is the process that we take when we create the interfaces
that people will be using when they interact with our apps.

Visual Design is the framework that allows us to create meaningful
interactions, and to help us tell stories that connect us with the
people that use our apps.
It helps us to direct and inform people, and ultimately it helps us to
help them to achieve their goals.

When Visual Design is executed correctly we can create delightful and
enjoyable experiences which can enrich peoples lives.

But, when Visual Design is not executed correctly, or even at all, it
can have catastrophic consequences.

## Why do we need Visual Design?

You have probably all experienced this at some point. You are trying to
achieve something, probably on a website. Maybe it's a tool for work or
school or some other kind of site. Maybe it looks like this ->
[deathtobullshit.com]
And you either can't find what you are looking for, or it is not clear
what you are meant to do. Or maybe there are too many conflicting things
all fighting for your attention, and you are getting frustrated.
So in the end you just give up and leave.
This is bad design.

The thing with good design is that it is invisible. Most of the time you
don't even know that it's there. It shows you the direction and then it
gets out of the way.

Good design is considered.

## What are some of the things that we need to think about when designing?

So if good design is considered, then what are some of the things that we
need to be thinking about when we are designing for our apps?

First we need to be thinking about the goals. The goals of our apps and
the goals of our users. Who are they and what are they trying to achieve?
What do we want them to achieve?
What does a successful interaction look like?

We also need to think about what the users environment might look like.
Now that we have mobile devices, tablets, laptops, desktops, watches,
game consoles, TV's, and cars! All of these things can be used to access
the internet, and therefore change the context of how our apps might
be used.

Where will our users be, and what will they be doing when using this app?
Will they be in the middle of town hurriedly trying to get from point A
to point B? Will they be sat in a cafe with friends? Will they be using
this app for work on a big 30-something inch iMac? Or will they be sat at
home in front of the TV with their family?

While we can't always tell the circumstances of how or when our apps will
be used, it is still good to be mindful of the possibilities.

We also need to consider the technical constraints. Can we use that fancy
new animation technique? Or do we have to still support people that are
running IE6, 7 & 8? These kinds of decisions will help to inform us of
what our designs can and can't do.

Another important thing we need to think about when designing for our apps
is all of the different states in which it could be. These kinds of apps
are never static. They tell a story. Every interaction has a beginning,
a middle, and an end. So what does it look like the very first time a user
opens it up and there is no data in it yet? What will it look like in a
couple of years time when there are hundreds of thousands of records?
What happens if something goes wrong and we need to display an
error message?

The voice and tone of your designs is also very important to keep in mind.
These can be literal things like how messages are worded when presented to
the user, or more abstract like the overall feel of the design. Is it fun
and fresh, or is it corporate and serious?

Thinking about all of these things will help you to design for the bigger
experience, and mean that your apps are more flexible and more enjoyable
to use. It will also mean that your designs will feel more consistent
which is extremely important.

But always remember to keep referring back to your goals.

## The key concepts of Visual Design — Strategy

Ok, so now we know what and why, lets talk about how to use Visual Design.
There are several key principals that we can use that will help us to
achieve our goals and to help our users to achieve theirs.

Hierarchy: (what is important?)
This helps us to establish and explain to the user what is important.
And it is one of the ways we can say "go this way". It can be done by using
different sizes and weights of fonts, or through different tones of colour.

Focus: (what do we want to show or emphasise?)
This helps us to get our point across and says "I want you to do this".
It could be done with a mixture of white space and a big heading, or by
emphasising a button.

Flow: (getting the user to their goal)
Flow is more of an over-arching concept and it is concerned with the steps
it takes to get the user to achieve their goal. This might be the way a
series of form fields are laid out, or by presenting something in a popover
so as to not remove the user from the context of the current page.

When used together, our techniques of Visual Design help us to enforce
these key concepts.

## Visual Design techniques — Tactics

So what techniques can we use to actually make these things happen?

### Typography

Typography is the art of working with type, and when used correctly it
allows us to set the right voice and tone for our designs. It helps us
to establish hierarchy and it can easily make, or break your design.

There are so many things to consider when talking about typography,
like font choice and pairing, using weights and styles to create texture,
or making sure you have the correct line-heights, line-lengths and sizing.

But here are a couple of rules that you can use to help you get started:

1. *Start with one font*. This will be your main font which you will use
   for the base of your designs. It needs to be clear and readable, and
   not have any fancy flourishes. Make sure it is something that has all
   of the characters you need, and comes with multiple weights and styles.
   This will allow you to create designs with nice typographical texture
   but without overwhelming or confusing your users.
   
2. *Pick a heading font*. This is where the style and character comes in.
   Now a heading font doesn't need to be a different font from your body
   font. It could actually be the same if it comes with enough variation.
   So you could use a light to medium weight for the body, and then use the
   bold condensed version for your headings. Or you could pick an entirely
   different font.
   
   When picking a second font I like to pick something either contrasting
   to the body font, or with a relationship to it. So if my body has a
   sans-serif font then I'll go with a serif for the heading.
   Or I might pick two fonts that come from the same time, or area, or
   two that come from the same type designer.
   
Ok, so taking a step back for a second. I mentioned the words `serif` and
`sans-serif`. Who knows what these mean?
Ok so, for those that don't, a serif is the little foot that appears at the
end of a character.
And 'Sans' means without. So a sans-serif typeface is one without the little
flared feet.

Ok, rule #3

3. If you really, REALLY have too, you can pick a third font choice, but
   *never use more than three fonts. Ever*. Seriously, don't do this. It
   will make your designs look like a scrapbook or a ransom note, and that's
   all-well-and-good for scrapbooks and ransom notes, but not for our apps.
   It makes things overwhelming and they just don't look good.
   
4. *Font size*. So this is a super easy way for us to create hierarchy.
   By making our headings larger than our body font we are saying this is
   important, read this first. If we have multiple levels of content then
   we step down a size with our next heading. This says this is the next
   important thing, but it is not as important as our previous thing.
   Generally speaking to work out these sizes I'll usually times my base
   font size by two or three and work back from there. So if my body font
   is 16px high, my heading one will be 32px and my second level heading
   would be 28px. 

As you can see there is a lot involved in just working out your typography.
There are whole books just dedicated to the subject. In fact if you want
a really good book to get you started on the subject, checkout Jason
Santa Maria's 'On Web Typography'.

### Colour

Colour. Ok I promise these other sections won't be as long.

Colour allows us to highlight items we want emphasised, and it is a great
way of creating feeling and mood in our design.

For instance if we want to highlight a success or error message that
provides feedback to our users, we could do this by putting them in a
coloured box. Green means 'go', and red means 'stop' right? So it could be
appropriate to use these colours to signify a success or error message.
Immediately our user will know that if she has received a red message then
something went wrong.
Just be careful that you know your audience. In some asian cultures red is
considered a positive colour, so this could be confusing.

But what about using colour for other, more general parts of your design?
So my general rule of thumb is to use only a couple of colours. I'll use
black and white or different tones of grey, coupled with one or two highlight
colours. And then just use a couple of different tones of that to create the
effect I want. The trick is to keep it subtle so that when you do use a bright,
impactful colour it has more weight for emphasis.

Depending on the design I actually try to steer away from using full on black
and white, instead dropping it back a notch and then shifting the hue slightly
to make it either warmer or cooler. This is because in real life there is no
such thing as truly black or white, it all has some kind of shade or tone
reflected through it. It is also a really subtle way of adding a little bit
of difference to your designs.

### Size
enforce hierarchy and flow
create realistic hit areas for actionable items
making things visible - even making something too big can make it so it's not visible.

### Contrast & Balance
the difference between two things
help with readability & usability

contrast in colour
contrast in size
contrast in typography (serif vs sans-serif; italic vs book; light vs bold)

test the extremes and then dial it in.

### Layout
spacing and grids
white space - breathing room
breaking the grid

### Imagery
use imagery to help enforce feeling, mood and emotions

icons
illustrations
photos
data visualisation

### Depth
can help create distinction between areas and enforce hierarchy and flow
creates interest
keep it subtle
flat design still has depth
overlaying objects (foreground/middle-ground/background?)

### Motion
directing the eye:
- reading left to right; top to bottom (in western cultures)
- forward & back; left & right.
physical motion - animations. keep it smooth; keep it subtle; keep it quick.
feedback - we have acted on something and it has responded

### Composition
putting it all together
fluid/responsive design
everything is an object - design modules that can be pieced together like blocks
