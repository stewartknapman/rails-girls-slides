# Elements of Visual Design

## Introduction

Hello. I am Stewart Knapman. I am a designer and front-end developer.
I work for a small, but mighty, design studio in Nelson called Lucid.
We specialise in building websites for small to medium sized businesses,
and mainly work with an e-commerce platform called Shopify.
Which, by the way, is built on top of Ruby on Rails.
It is also just one of the platforms that we use on a daily basis that
is either built on, or influenced by Ruby and the Rails framework.

So, I'm going to take you through a little bit of about what
Visual Design is; _why_ we need it; and then finish up with some rules
or guidelines on how we can use it in our apps to create
great experiences.

## What is Visual Design?

So what is Visual Design, and why do we care?
Visual Design is the process that we take when we create the interfaces
that people will be using when they interact with our apps.

Visual Design is the framework that allows us to create meaningful
interactions, and to help us tell stories that connect us with the
people that use our apps.
It helps us to direct and inform people, and ultimately it helps us to
help them to achieve their goals.

When Visual Design is executed correctly we can create delightful and
enjoyable experiences which can enrich peoples lives.

But, when Visual Design is not executed correctly, or even at all, it
can have catastrophic consequences.

## Why do we need Visual Design?

You have probably all experienced this at some point. You are trying to
achieve something, probably on a website. Maybe it's a tool for work or
school or another kind of site. Maybe it looks like this ->
[deathtobullshit.com]
And you either can't find what you are looking for, or it is not clear
what you are meant to do. Or maybe there are too many conflicting things
all fighting for your attention, and you are getting frustrated.
So in the end you just give up and leave.
This is bad design.

The thing with good design is that it is invisible. Most of the time you
don't even know that it is there. It shows you the direction and then it
gets out of the way.

Good design is considered.

## What are some of the things that we need to think about when designing?

So if good design is considered, then what are some of the things that we
need to be thinking about when we are designing for our apps?

First we need to be thinking about the goals. The goals of our apps and
the goals of our users. Who are they and what are they trying to achieve?
What do we want them to achieve?
What does a successful interaction look like?

What does the users environment look like? Now we have mobile devices,
tablets, laptops, desktops, watches, game consoles, TV's, and cars! All
of these things can be used to access the internet, and therefore change
the context of how our apps might be used.

Where will our users be, and what will they be doing when using this app?
Will they be in the middle of town hurriedly trying to get from point A
to point B? Will they be sat in a cafe with friends? Will they be using
this app for work on a big 30-something inch iMac? Or will they be sat at
home in front of the TV with their family?

While we can't always tell the circumstances of how or when our apps will
be used, it is still good to be mindful of the possibilities.

We also need to consider the technical constraints. Can we use that fancy
new animation technique? Or do we have to still support people that are
running IE6, 7 & 8? These kinds of decisions will help to inform us of
what our designs can and can't do.

Another important thing we need to think about when designing for our apps
is all of the different states in which it could be. These kinds of apps
are never static. They tell a story. Every interaction has a beginning,
a middle, and an end. What does it look like the very first time a user
opens it up and there is no data in it yet? What will it look like in a
couple of years when there are hundreds of thousands of records?
What happens if something goes wrong and we need to display an
error message?

The voice and tone of your designs is also very important to keep in mind.
These can be literal things like how messages are worded when presented to
the user, or more abstract like the overall feel of the design. Is it fun
and fresh, or is it corporate and serious?

Thinking about all of these things will help you to design for the bigger
experience, and mean that your apps are more flexible and more enjoyable
to use. It will also mean that your designs will feel more consistent
which is important.

But always remember to keep referring back to your goals.







### what are some of the things that we are trying to achieve?
[All of the 'hows' help to inform and enforce these key concepts:
- hierarchy - what is important?
- focus - what do we want to show or emphasise?
- meaning - what are we trying to say?
- flow - getting the user to their goal]

## How?

### Typography
hierarchy
limit fonts use 1–2, if you really really have to use three, but never any more!
Use weight and styles to create texture

### Colour
highlight and direction
positive/negative - success/error
feeling and texture

### Size
enforce hierarchy and flow
create realistic hit areas for actionable items
making things visible - even making something too big can make it so it's not visible.

### Contrast & Balance
the difference between two things
help with readability & usability

contrast in colour
contrast in size
contrast in typography (serif vs sans-serif; italic vs book; light vs bold)

test the extremes and then dial it in.

### Layout
spacing and grids
white space - breathing room
breaking the grid

### Imagery
use imagery to help enforce feeling, mood and emotions

icons
illustrations
photos
data visualisation

### Depth
can help create distinction between areas and enforce hierarchy and flow
creates interest
keep it subtle
flat design still has depth
overlaying objects (foreground/middle-ground/background?)

### Motion
directing the eye:
- reading left to right; top to bottom (in western cultures)
- forward & back; left & right.
physical motion - animations. keep it smooth; keep it subtle; keep it quick.
feedback - we have acted on something and it has responded

### Composition
putting it all together
fluid/responsive design
everything is an object - design modules that can be pieced together like blocks

## Homework
Reading:
- On web typography — Jason Santa Maria (ABA)
- Responsive Web Design — Ethan Marcotte (ABA)
- Design is a job — Mike Monteiro (ABA)
- The Shape of Design — Frank Chimero
- Web form design — Luke Wroblewski
- Atomic Design — Brad Frost (when it's finished)

Actually read all the ABA books
