# Elements of Visual Design

## Introduction

Hello. I am Stewart Knapman. I am a designer and front-end developer.
I work for a small, but mighty, design studio in Nelson called Lucid.
We specialise in building websites for small to medium sized businesses,
and mainly work with an e-commerce platform called Shopify.
Which, by the way, is built on top of Ruby on Rails.
It is also just one of the platforms that we use on a daily basis that
is either built on, or influenced by Ruby and the Rails framework.

So, I'm going to take you through a little bit of about what
Visual Design is; _why_ we need it; and then finish up with some rules
or guidelines on how we can use it in our apps to create
great experiences.

## What is Visual Design?

So what is Visual Design, and why do we even care?
Well, for us at least, Visual Design is the process that we will use when
we create the interfaces that people will be using when they interact
with our apps.

Visual Design is the framework that allows us to create meaningful
interactions, and to help us tell stories that connect us with the
people that use our apps.
It helps us to direct and inform people, and ultimately it helps us to
help them to achieve their goals.

When Visual Design is executed correctly we can create delightful and
enjoyable experiences which can enrich peoples lives.

But, when Visual Design is not executed correctly, or even at all, it
can have catastrophic consequences.

## Why do we need Visual Design?

You have probably all experienced this at some point. You are trying to
achieve something, probably on a website. Maybe it's a tool for work or
school or some other kind of site. Maybe it looks like this ->
[deathtobullshit.com]
And you either can't find what you are looking for, or it is not clear
what you are meant to do. Or maybe there are too many conflicting things
all fighting for your attention, and you are getting frustrated.
So in the end you just give up and leave.
This is bad design.

The thing with good design is that it is invisible. Most of the time you
don't even know that it's there. It shows you the direction and then it
gets out of the way.

Good design is considered.

## What are some of the things that we need to think about when designing?

So if good design is considered, then what are some of the things that we
need to be thinking about when we are designing for our apps?

First we need to be thinking about the goals. The goals of our apps and
the goals of our users. Who are they and what are they trying to achieve?
What do we want them to achieve?
What does a successful interaction look like?

We also need to think about what the users environment might look like.
Now that we have mobile devices, tablets, laptops, desktops, watches,
game consoles, TV's, and cars! All of these things can be used to access
the internet, and therefore change the context of how our apps might
be used.

Where will our users be, and what will they be doing when using this app?
Will they be in the middle of town hurriedly trying to get from point A
to point B? Will they be sat in a cafe with friends? Will they be using
this app for work on a big 30-something inch iMac? Or will they be sat at
home in front of the TV with their family?

While we can't always tell the circumstances of how or when our apps will
be used, it is still good to be mindful of the possibilities.

We also need to consider the technical constraints. Can we use that fancy
new animation technique? Or do we have to still support people that are
running IE6, 7 & 8? These kinds of decisions will help to inform us of
what our designs can and can't do.

Another important thing we need to think about when designing for our apps
is all of the different states in which it could be. These kinds of apps
are never static. They tell a story. Every interaction has a beginning,
a middle, and an end. So what does it look like the very first time a user
opens it up and there is no data in it yet? What will it look like in a
couple of years time when there are hundreds of thousands of records?
What happens if something goes wrong and we need to display an
error message? These are just some of the things you need to keep in mind.

The voice and tone of your designs is also very important to keep in mind.
These can be literal things like how messages are worded when presented to
the user, or more abstract like the overall feel of the design. Is it fun
and fresh, or is it corporate and serious?

Thinking about all of these things will help you to design for the bigger
experience, and mean that your apps are more flexible and more enjoyable
to use. It will also mean that your designs will feel more consistent
which is extremely important.

But always remember to keep referring back to your original goals.

## The key concepts of Visual Design — Strategy

Ok, so now we know what and why, lets talk about how to use Visual Design.
There are several key principals that we can use that will help us to
achieve our goals and to help our users to achieve theirs.

Hierarchy: (what is important?)
This helps us to establish and explain to the user what is important.
And it is one of the ways we can say "go this way". It can be done by using
different sizes and weights of fonts, or through different tones of colour.

Focus: (what do we want to show or emphasise?)
This helps us to get our point across and says "I want you to do this".
It could be done with a mixture of white space and a big heading, or by
emphasising a button.

Flow: (getting the user to their goal)
Flow is more of an over-arching concept and it is concerned with the steps
it takes to get the user to achieve their goal. This might be the way a
series of form fields are laid out, or by presenting something in a popover
so as to not remove the user from the context of the current page.

When used together, our techniques of Visual Design help us to enforce
these key concepts.

## Visual Design techniques — Tactics

So what techniques can we use to actually make these things happen?

### Typography

Typography is the art of working with type, and when used correctly it
allows us to set the right voice and tone for our designs. It helps us
to establish hierarchy and it can easily make, or break your design.

There are so many things to consider when talking about typography,
like font choice and pairing, using weights and styles to create texture,
or making sure you have the correct line-heights, line-lengths and sizing.

But here are a couple of rules that you can use to help you get started:

1. *Start with one font*. This will be your main font which you will use
   for the base of your designs. It needs to be clear and readable, and
   not have any fancy flourishes. Make sure it is something that has all
   of the characters you need, and comes with multiple weights and styles.
   This will allow you to create designs with nice typographical texture
   but without overwhelming or confusing your users.
   
2. *Pick a heading font*. This is where the style and character comes in.
   Now a heading font doesn't need to be a different font from your body
   font. It could actually be the same if it comes with enough variation.
   So you could use a light to medium weight for the body, and then use the
   bold condensed version for your headings. Or you could pick an entirely
   different font.
   
   When picking a second font I like to pick something either contrasting
   to the body font, or with a relationship to it. So if my body has a
   sans-serif font then I'll go with a serif for the heading.
   Or I might pick two fonts that come from the same time, or area, or
   that come from the same type designer.
   
Ok, so taking a step back for a second. I mentioned the words `serif`
and `sans-serif`. Who knows what these mean?
Ok so, for those that don't, a serif is the little foot that appears at
the end of a character.
And 'Sans' means without. So a sans-serif typeface is one without the
little flared foot thingy.

Ok, rule #3

3. If you really, REALLY have too, you can pick a third font choice, but
   *never use more than three fonts. Ever!*. Seriously, don't do it. It
   will make your designs look like a scrapbook or a ransom note, and that's
   all-well-and-good for scrapbooks and ransom notes, but not for our apps.
   It makes things overwhelming and they just don't look good.
   
4. *Font size*. So this is a super easy way for us to create hierarchy.
   By making our headings larger than our body font we are saying this is
   important, read this first. If we have multiple levels of content then
   we step down a size with our next heading. This says this is the next
   important thing, but it is not as important as our previous thing.
   Generally speaking to work out these sizes I'll usually times my base
   font size by two or three and work back from there. So if my body font
   is 16px high, my heading will be 32px and my second level heading
   would be 28px. 

As you can see there is a lot involved in just working out your typography.
There are whole books just dedicated to the subject. In fact if you want
a really good book to get you started on the subject, checkout Jason
Santa Maria's 'On Web Typography'.

### Colour

Colour. Ok I promise these other sections won't be as long as that last one.

Colour allows us to highlight items we want emphasised, and it is a great
way of creating feeling and mood in our design.

For instance if we want to highlight a success or error message that
provides feedback to our users, we could do this by putting them in a
coloured box. Green means 'go', and red means 'stop' right? So it could be
appropriate to use these colours to signify a success or error message.
Immediately our user will know that if she has received a red message then
something went wrong.
Just be careful that you know your audience. In some asian cultures red is
considered a positive colour, so this could be confusing.

But what about using colour for other, more general parts of your design?
So my general rule of thumb is to use only a couple of colours. I'll use
black and white or different tones of grey, coupled with one or two highlight
colours. And then just use a couple of different tones of that to create the
effect I want. The trick is to keep it subtle so that when you do use a bright,
impactful colour it has more weight for emphasis.

Depending on the design I actually try to steer away from using full on black
and white, instead dropping it back a notch and then shifting the hue slightly
to make it either warmer or cooler. This is because in real life there is no
such thing as truly black or white, it all has some kind of shade or tone
reflected through it. It is also a really subtle way of adding a little bit
of difference to your designs, making them look less boring.

### Size

Using different sizes of elements allows us to enforce hierarchy and to create 
a flow between different parts of our design. As we saw with typography
something that is bigger can create a sense of being more important. This allows
us to direct users to the parts of our applications that we want them to focus on.

~~Making something too big can actually be the same as making some too small, when
it expands from our view it is no longer visible. This can be used to create an
interesting effect where we make a texture that blends into the background.~~

Size is also very important when it comes to actionable items in your deigns.
Make sure you have enough room for your users to click on a link or a button.
Remember that with touch devices your users may be using their thumb or fingers
to press a button, and this requires more room than a standard mouse cursor.
If you haven't allowed for enough room to tap on something then you run the risk
of people tapping on the wrong things, which can cause frustration.

### Contrast & Balance

Contrast is how we show the difference between things.
You can have contrast in colour - Black & White; Darks & Lights.
You can have contrast in size - Big vs Small.
And you can have contrast in Typography - Serif vs Sans-serif; Italic vs Book;
Light and expanded vs Bold and condensed.

Too little contrast can make it hard for people to differentiate between things.
Like if your text and background colours are too close, or if the size of your
headings is the same as your body text.

Too much contrast can make your designs feel inconsistent and disjointed.
The best way to deal with it is to test the extremes to see how they look and
then to dial it in from there, until you have worked out a nice balance.

### Layout

Layout is when we start bringing order to our content and establishing the flow.

In design, it is always a good idea to base your content on a grid. Grids allow
us to create a rhythm between elements. It helps us to line things up and it
gives us control.

Once you know how to work with a grid, you can try your hand at breaking it.
This is a great technique for creating focus and emphasising an element.
But use this sparingly and with caution. If you do it to much, then you may
as well not be using a grid at all.

Spacing is also an important part of layout. Using negative or white space
around your elements allows them to breath. If things are to close together
then they start to look cluttered. Contrary to popular belief white space
is actually something that you can have a lot of. Using lots of white space
can have an effect of making your designs look expensive, like you have so
much money to throw away on empty areas, rather than spending it all on
trying to cram as much content in as possible.

### Imagery

Using imagery in your designs is an effective way to help re-enforce
feeling, mood and emotions. It is also a good way to remove written
content, that might take up too much space in your designs while still
delivering your message.

Icons can be extremely helpful when trying to convey a message, especially
if your users speak different languages.

Other types of imagery you can use are illustrations, photos and data
visualisation like graphs or maps. These all help to create a rich experience
for your users and to create interest.

### Composition

Ok, last one.
Composition, lets start pulling it all together.

So by now we should have all of these beautifully designed elements. All
of our images, forms and buttons look nice; our type is clear and readable;
and we have a clear idea of the structure and feeling of things.

So one thing I have been trying to do more recently, and I know other
designers are talking more and more about this concept, is when designing for
the web try to approach the elements as modules. Designing each part or item
as an object that we can then piece together and reuse like lego blocks. And 
you'll see why in a minute.

Lets go back to our phones and tablets, our TV's and watches and whatnot.
Notice how none of these have the same size screen? Even if you where to look
at two or three different phones, they would all have different screen sizes.

So how do we make sure that our designs work across all of these devices,
while still looking good? Right?! Well, we are going to use a concept called
Responsive Web Design. Responsive Design means that our designs will "respond"
to the size of the screen that they are given. And we do this by treating
everything as being fluid, kind of like water in a glass.

For instance if we had a table showing a list of users, instead of saying
that it is 960px wide, we would say that it is 80% wide. So now it doesn't
matter what screen size we have our table will fit into the space that
it's given.

So lets start small with a phone. We add in only the content that we need
for our apps to work. We might decide that we have too many navigation
options to show them all on the screen at once, so we pick the most important
ones and show them to the user and put the rest into a sidebar that sits off
the side off the screen, which can then be called in when we need it.

As we increase the screen size we can start to make things a little bigger,
and start increasing the spacing around things as we have more room to breath.

Our screen gets a little bigger again and now we have enough room to show
those navigation items, so we pull the sidebar back into the screen.

And we keep going, adjusting the size and reflowing those nicely designed items.
Every time things start to look a little strange, like the length of a line of
text looks too long, then we add a breakpoint, adjust it and then keep going.

There is a bit more to it than just, but if you are interested I'd suggest
checking out Ethan Marcotte's book on Responsive Web Design.

## Outro

Cool. That's about it.
I hope that has been helpful for you all. And it gives you some ideas on how
to make your apps better.

If you are keen to see a bit more of these things put into practise, I will be
taking the advanced front-end class after lunch. Your more than welcome to
come along.

And if you're interested in learning even more there are a heap of books on
these subjects. These are just some of my favourites.
