# Elements of Visual Design

Visual Design is how we create 

## Why?

consistency
usability
can create a delightful and enjoyable experience when done correctly - feeling and emotion
it _will_ create a bad experience when not done correctly - have you ever been really frustrated?
helps direct the user to achieve their goal

design should be invisible; it shows you the direction and then gets out of the way.
good design is a conversation between both parties (in this case yourself and the user)

## What?

### what are some of the things that we need to think about when designing?
goals (of the user and of the application)
the users needs
the users environments
scope and technology constraints
all browsers are different
always refer back to your goals
states - telling a story: beginning, middle and end; empty & full; incomplete & finished.

### what are some of the things that we are trying to achieve?
key concepts:
hierarchy - what is important
flow - getting the user to their goal

## How?

### Typography
hierarchy
limit fonts use 1–2, if you really really have to use three, but never any more!
Use weight and styles to create texture

### Colour
highlight and direction
positive/negative - success/error
feeling and texture

### Contrast
readability
usability

### Layout
spacing and grids

### Depth
can help create distinction between areas and enforce hierarchy and flow
creates interest
keep it subtle
flat design still has depth
overlaying objects (foreground/middle-ground/background?)

### Motion
directing the eye:
- reading left to right; top to bottom (in western cultures)
- forward & back; left & right.
physical motion - animations. keep it smooth; keep it subtle; keep it quick.

### Composition
putting it all together
fluid/responsive design
everything is an object - design modules that can be pieced together like blocks
