            <p>Hello. I am Stewart Knapman. I am a designer and front-end developer. I work for a small, but mighty, design studio in Nelson called Lucid. We specialise in building websites for small to medium sized businesses, and mainly work with an e-commerce platform called Shopify. Which, by the way, is built on top of Ruby on Rails. It is also just one of the platforms that we use on a daily basis that is either built on, or influenced by Ruby and the Rails framework.</p>

            <div class="slide-count">3/35</div>
            <p>So, I'm going to take you through a little bit of about what Visual Design is; <em>why</em> we need it; and then finish up with some rules or guidelines on how we can use it in our apps to create great experiences.</p><p>So what is Visual Design, and why do we even care?</p>

          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">4/35</div>
            <p>Well, for us at least, Visual Design is the process that we will use when we create the interfaces that people will be using when they interact with our apps.</p>

          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">5/35</div>
            <p>Visual Design is the framework that allows us to create meaningful interactions, and to help us tell stories that connect us with the people that use our apps. It helps us to direct and inform people, and ultimately it helps us to help them to achieve their goals.</p><p>When Visual Design is executed correctly we can create delightful and enjoyable experiences which can enrich peoples lives.</p><p>But, when Visual Design is not executed correctly, or even at all, it can have catastrophic consequences.</p>

            <p>The thing with good design is that it is invisible. Most of the time you don't even know that it's there. It shows you the direction and then it gets out of the way.</p><p>Good design is considered.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">9/35</div>
            <p>So if good design is considered, then what are some of the things that we need to be thinking about when we are designing for our apps?</p><p>First we need to be thinking about the goals. The goals of our apps and the goals of our users. Who are they and what are they trying to achieve? What do we want them to achieve? What does a successful interaction look like?</p><p>We also need to think about what the users environment might look like. Now that we have mobile devices, tablets, laptops, desktops, watches, game consoles, TV's, and cars! All of these things can be used to access the internet, and therefore change the context of how our apps might be used.</p><p>Where will our users be, and what will they be doing when using this app? Will they be in the middle of town hurriedly trying to get from point A to point B? Will they be sat in a cafe with friends? Will they be using this app for work on a big 30-something inch iMac? Or will they be sat at home in front of the TV with their family?</p><p>While we can't always tell the circumstances of how or when our apps will be used, it is still good to be mindful of the possibilities.</p><p>We also need to consider the technical constraints. Can we use that fancy new animation technique? Or do we have to still support people that are running IE6, 7 & 8? These kinds of decisions will help to inform us of what our designs can and can't do.</p><p>Another important thing we need to think about when designing for our apps is all of the different states in which it could be. These kinds of apps are never static. They tell a story. Every interaction has a beginning, a middle, and an end. So what does it look like the very first time a user opens it up and there is no data in it yet? What will it look like in a couple of years time when there are hundreds of thousands of records? What happens if something goes wrong and we need to display an error message? These are just some of the things you need to keep in mind.</p><p>The voice and tone of your designs is also very important to keep in mind. These can be literal things like how messages are worded when presented to the user, or more abstract like the overall feel of the design. Is it fun and fresh, or is it corporate and serious?</p><p>Thinking about all of these things will help you to design for the bigger experience, and mean that your apps are more flexible and more enjoyable to use. It will also mean that your designs will feel more consistent which is extremely important.</p><p>But always remember to keep referring back to your original goals.</p>

            <p>Hierarchy: (what is important?)</p><p>This helps us to establish and explain to the user what is important. And it is one of the ways we can say 'go this way'. It can be done by using different sizes and weights of fonts, or through different tones of colour.</p>

            <div class="slide-count">12/35</div>
            <p>Focus: (what do we want to show or emphasise?)</p><p>This helps us to get our point across and says 'I want you to do this'. It could be done with a mixture of white space and a big heading, or by emphasising a button.</p>

            <p>Flow: (getting the user to their goal)</p><p>Flow is more of an over-arching concept and it is concerned with the steps it takes to get the user to achieve their goal. This might be the way a series of form fields are laid out, or by presenting something in a popover so as to not remove the user from the context of the current page.</p><p>When used together, our techniques of Visual Design help us to enforce these key concepts.</p>

            <h3>Typography</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">15/35</div>
            <p>Typography is the art of working with type, and when used correctly it allows us to set the right voice and tone for our designs. It helps us to establish hierarchy and it can easily make, or break your design.</p><p>There are so many things to consider when talking about typography, like font choice and pairing, using weights and styles to create texture, or making sure you have the correct line-heights, line-lengths and sizing.</p><p>But here are a couple of rules that you can use to help you get started:</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      
        <li id="slide-16" data-slide>
          <div class="slide-content ">
            <p><em>Typography rule #1</em></p><h3>Start with one font.</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">16/35</div>
            <p>1. <strong>Start with one font</strong>. This will be your main font which you will use for the base of your designs. It needs to be clear and readable, and not have any fancy flourishes. Make sure it is something that has all of the characters you need, and comes with multiple weights and styles. This will allow you to create designs with nice typographical texture but without overwhelming or confusing your users.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      
        <li id="slide-17" data-slide>
          <div class="slide-content ">
            <p><em>Typography rule #2</em></p><h3>Choose a heading font.</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">17/35</div>
            <p>2. <strong>Pick a heading font</strong>. This is where the style and character comes in. Now a heading font doesn't need to be a different font from your body font. It could actually be the same if it comes with enough variation. So you could use a light to medium weight for the body, and then use the bold condensed version for your headings. Or you could pick an entirely different font.</p><p>When picking a second font I like to pick something either contrasting to the body font, or with a relationship to it. So if my body has a sans-serif font then I'll go with a serif for the heading. Or I might pick two fonts that come from the same time, or area, or that come from the same type designer.</p><p>Ok, so taking a step back for a second. I mentioned the words `serif` and `sans-serif`. Who knows what these mean?</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      
        <li id="slide-18" data-slide>
          <div class="slide-content ">
            <img src='img/serif_vs_sans_serif.jpg'>
          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">18/35</div>
            <p>Ok so, for those that don't, a serif is the little foot that appears at the end of a character.<br>And 'Sans' means without. So a sans-serif typeface is one without the little flared foot thingy.</p><p>Ok, rule #3</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      
        <li id="slide-19" data-slide>
          <div class="slide-content ">
            <p><em>Typography rule #3</em></p><h3>Never <em>ever</em> use more than three&nbsp;fonts.</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">19/35</div>
            <p>3. If you really, REALLY have too, you can pick a third font choice, but <strong>never use more than three fonts. Ever!</strong>. Seriously, don't do it. It will make your designs look like a scrapbook or a ransom note, and that's all-well-and-good for scrapbooks and ransom notes, but not for our apps. It makes things overwhelming and they just don't look good.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      
        <li id="slide-20" data-slide>
          <div class="slide-content ">
            <p><em>Typography rule #4</em></p><h3>Create a hierarchy with your&nbsp;headings.</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">20/35</div>
            <p>4. <strong>Font size</strong>. So this is a super easy way for us to create hierarchy. By making our headings larger than our body font we are saying this is important, read this first. If we have multiple levels of content then we step down a size with our next heading. This says this is the next important thing, but it is not as important as our previous thing. Generally speaking to work out these sizes I'll usually times my base font size by two or three and work back from there. So if my body font is 16px high, my heading will be 32px and my second level heading would be 28px.</p><p>As you can see there is a lot involved in just working out your typography. There are whole books just dedicated to the subject. In fact if you want a really good book to get you started on the subject, checkout Jason Santa Maria's 'On Web Typography'.</p>
          </div>

        <li id="slide-21" data-slide>
          <div class="slide-content ">
            <h3>Colour</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">21/35</div>
            <p>Colour. Ok I promise these other sections won't be as long as that last one.</p><p>Colour allows us to highlight items we want emphasised, and it is a great way of creating feeling and mood in our design.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      
        <li id="slide-22" data-slide>
          <div class="slide-content ">
            <div class='alert-success'><span class='mdi mdi-checkbox-marked-circle'></span><h4>Success!</h4><small>Congratulations, you did it!</small></div><div class='alert-error'><span class='mdi mdi-alert-circle'></span><h4>Oh No!</h4><small>Something went horribly wrong!</small></div>
          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">22/35</div>
            <p>For instance if we want to highlight a success or error message that provides feedback to our users, we could do this by putting them in a coloured box. Green means 'go', and red means 'stop' right? So it could be appropriate to use these colours to signify a success or error message. Immediately our user will know that if she has received a red message then something went wrong.</p><p>Just be careful that you know your audience. In some asian cultures red is considered a positive colour, so this could be confusing.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      
        <li id="slide-23" data-slide>
          <div class="slide-content ">
            <img src='img/todo.jpg'>
          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">23/35</div>
            <p>But what about using colour for other, more general parts of your design? So my general rule of thumb is to use only a couple of colours. I'll use black and white or different tones of grey, coupled with one or two highlight colours. And then just use a couple of different tones of that to create the effect I want. The trick is to keep it subtle so that when you do use a bright, impactful colour it has more weight for emphasis.</p><p>Depending on the design I actually try to steer away from using full on black and white, instead dropping it back a notch and then shifting the hue slightly to make it either warmer or cooler. This is because in real life there is no such thing as truly black or white, it all has some kind of shade or tone reflected through it. It is also a really subtle way of adding a little bit of difference to your designs, making them look less boring.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      
        <li id="slide-24" data-slide>
          <div class="slide-content ">
            <h3>Size</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">24/35</div>
            <p>Using different sizes of elements allows us to enforce hierarchy and to create a flow between different parts of our design. As we saw with typography something that is bigger can create a sense of being more important. This allows us to direct users to the parts of our applications that we want them to focus on.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      
        <li id="slide-25" data-slide>
          <div class="slide-content ">
            <div class='btn-wrap'><button class='btn-big'>Go</button><span class='mdi mdi-checkbox-blank-circle'></span></div><div class='btn-wrap'><button class='btn-sml'>Go</button><span class='mdi mdi-cursor-default'></span></div>
          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">25/35</div>
            <p>Size is also very important when it comes to actionable items in your deigns. Make sure you have enough room for your users to click on a link or a button. Remember that with touch devices your users may be using their thumb or fingers to press a button, and this requires more room than a standard mouse cursor. If you haven't allowed for enough room to tap on something then you run the risk of people tapping on the wrong things, which can cause frustration.</p>

            <p>Too little contrast can make it hard for people to differentiate between things. Like if your text and background colours are too close, or if the size of your headings is the same as your body text.</p><p>Too much contrast can make your designs feel inconsistent and disjointed. The best way to deal with it is to test the extremes to see how they look and then to dial it in from there, until you have worked out a nice balance.</p>

          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">28/35</div>
            <p>Layout is when we start bringing order to our content and establishing the flow.</p>
          </div>

            <div class="slide-count">29/35</div>
            <p>In design, it is always a good idea to base your content on a grid. Grids allow us to create a rhythm between elements. It helps us to line things up and it gives us control.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      
        <li id="slide-30" data-slide>
          <div class="slide-content ">
            <div class='grid-break'><ul><li class='heading-item'>Heading</li><li>List item</li><li>List item</li><li class='active-item'>Active item</li><li>List item</li><li>List item</li></ul></div>
          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">30/35</div>
            <p>Once you know how to work with a grid, you can try your hand at breaking it. This is a great technique for creating focus and emphasising an element. But use this sparingly and with caution. If you do it to much, then you may as well not be using a grid at all.</p><p>Spacing is also an important part of layout. Using negative or white space around your elements allows them to breath. If things are to close together then they start to look cluttered. Contrary to popular belief white space is actually something that you can have a lot of. Using lots of white space can have an effect of making your designs look expensive, like you have so much money to throw away on empty areas, rather than spending it all on trying to cram as much content in as possible.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">31/35</div>
            <p>Using imagery in your designs is an effective way to help re-enforce feeling, mood and emotions. It is also a good way to remove written content, that might take up too much space in your designs while still delivering your message.</p>

        </li>
      
        <li id="slide-32" data-slide>

          <div class="slide-notes">
            <div class="slide-count">32/35</div>
            <p>Icons can be extremely helpful when trying to convey a message, especially if your users speak different languages.</p><p>Other types of imagery you can use are illustrations, photos and data visualisation like graphs or maps. These all help to create a rich experience for your users and to create interest.</p>

            <p>Ok, last one.<br>Composition, lets start pulling it all together.</p><p>So by now we should have all of these beautifully designed elements. All of our images, forms and buttons look nice; our type is clear and readable; and we have a clear idea of the structure and feeling of things.</p>
