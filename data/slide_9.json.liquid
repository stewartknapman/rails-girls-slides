  "notes": "<p>So if good design is considered, then what are some of the things that we need to be thinking about when we are designing for our apps?</p><p>First we need to be thinking about the goals. The goals of our apps and the goals of our users. Who are they and what are they trying to achieve? What do we want them to achieve? What does a successful interaction look like?</p><p>We also need to think about what the users environment might look like. Now that we have mobile devices, tablets, laptops, desktops, watches, game consoles, TV's, and cars! All of these things can be used to access the internet, and therefore change the context of how our apps might be used.</p><p>Where will our users be, and what will they be doing when using this app? Will they be in the middle of town hurriedly trying to get from point A to point B? Will they be sat in a cafe with friends? Will they be using this app for work on a big 30-something inch iMac? Or will they be sat at home in front of the TV with their family?</p><p>While we can't always tell the circumstances of how or when our apps will be used, it is still good to be mindful of the possibilities.</p><p>We also need to consider the technical constraints. Can we use that fancy new animation technique? Or do we have to still support people that are running IE6, 7 & 8? These kinds of decisions will help to inform us of what our designs can and can't do.</p><p>Another important thing we need to think about when designing for our apps is all of the different states in which it could be. These kinds of apps are never static. They tell a story. Every interaction has a beginning, a middle, and an end. So what does it look like the very first time a user opens it up and there is no data in it yet? What will it look like in a couple of years time when there are hundreds of thousands of records? What happens if something goes wrong and we need to display an error message? These are just some of the things you need to keep in mind.</p><p>The voice and tone of your designs is also very important to keep in mind. These can be literal things like how messages are worded when presented to the user, or more abstract like the overall feel of the design. Is it fun and fresh, or is it corporate and serious?</p><p>Thinking about all of these things will help you to design for the bigger experience, and mean that your apps are more flexible and more enjoyable to use. It will also mean that your designs will feel more consistent which is extremely important.</p><p>But always remember to keep referring back to your original goals.</p>",
