  "notes": "<p>For instance if we had a table showing a list of users, instead of saying that it is 960px wide, we would say that it is 80% wide. So now it doesn't matter what screen size we have our table will fit into the space that it's given.</p><p>So lets start small with a phone. We add in only the content that we need for our apps to work. We might decide that we have too many navigation options to show them all on the screen at once, so we pick the most important ones and show them to the user and put the rest into a sidebar that sits off the side off the screen, which can then be called in when we need it.</p><p>As we increase the screen size we can start to make things a little bigger, and start increasing the spacing around things as we have more room to breath.</p><p>Our screen gets a little bigger again and now we have enough room to show those navigation items, so we pull the sidebar back into the screen.</p><p>And we keep going, adjusting the size and reflowing those nicely designed items. Every time things start to look a little strange, like the length of a line of text looks too long, then we add a breakpoint, adjust it and then keep going.</p><p>There is a bit more to it than just, but if you are interested I'd suggest checking out Ethan Marcotte's book on Responsive Web Design.</p>",
